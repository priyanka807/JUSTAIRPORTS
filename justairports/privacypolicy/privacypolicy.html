      <p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and appreciate the importance of responsible use of personal data collected on this website. We take great care with personal information, taking steps to keep it secure and ensure it is used only for our legitimate business purposes in accordance with applicable law.</p>
      <p>This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>
      <p><strong>INFORMATION ON THE COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
      <p>In the following, we inform you about the collection and processing of personal data when using our website. Personal data means individual information on personal or factual circumstances being attributable to an identified or identifiable natural person.
      The company responsible is Justairports Chauffeur Services Ltd (hereinafter also referred to as "Justairports" or "we"), 1378, Uxbridge Road, Uxbridge � UB10 0NQ. You can contact our data protection officer by sending an e-mail via the contact form on our website.
      When contacting us by e-mail, the data you provide (your e-mail address, if applicable, your first and last name and your telephone number) will be stored by us in order to answer your questions.</p>
      <p></p><p><strong>SUBJECT OF THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION</strong></p><p></p>
      <p>This privacy policy applies to all services offered on our website. This Data Protection Declaration exclusively deals with the handling of personal data by JUSTAIRPORTS. In case our services are performed by subcontractors, you will find the information on the respective procedures below. In case you make use of services provided by third parties via the website, the data protection regulations of the respective third parties apply exclusively. JUSTAIRPORTS does not check the data protection regulations of third parties. </p>
      <p><strong>COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA WHEN USING OUR SERVICES</strong></p>
      <p>We collect, store and process personal data in accordance with GDPR for the handling of the transportation services and the technical administration. Any and all personal data is processed exclusively in accordance with the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
      <p><strong>USE OF OUR SERVICES</strong></p>
      <p>To book a transfer we need your first and last name, your e-mail address, mobile phone number and specific payment information. We need the first and last name, e-mail address and mobile phone number to confirm the receipt of your booking, identify you as a user and communicate with you. We need credit card information or billing information to process the payment.</p>
      <p>If you use our website, we will store your data required for the performance of the contract. Furthermore, we store the data provided by you voluntarily for the duration of your use of the website, provided that you do not delete it before. </p>
      <p>In order to prevent unauthorised access to your personal data, especially payment information, the connection is encrypted.</p>
      <p>It is your obligation to treat the personal access data confidentially and not to make them accessible to any unauthorised third parties. We do not assume any liability for the abuse of losing information (your password, reservation reference number and email address), unless we are responsible for the abuse.</p>
      <p>Your personal data will only be passed on or otherwise communicated to third parties if this is necessary (i) for the purpose of performing our contractual obligations or (ii) the handling of payment transactions or (iii) if there is a legitimate interest of JUSTAIRPORTS or the third party or (iv) if you have previously given your consent. This means that the transportation service provider or other external providers of services (external fleet partner), as well as their respective drivers executing the transfers, receive the necessary information (first and last name, mobile phone number, flight number, pickup address, destination address and time of arrival as well as information on extra requests) via the website. Moreover, for credit card payment purposes the payment processor Stripe receives the necessary information (first and last name, mobile phone number, credit card information). In addition to the before-mentioned third parties, your data will be processed by internal software within our business enabling us to provide customer support and to perform bookings. All software tools are GDPR compliant and the data is exclusively processed on an as-needed basis. Your data might be processed by employees of subsidiaries of JUSTAIRPORTS, which are obliged to comply with the same strict GDPR rules as JUSTAIRPORTS itself. The data passed on in this way may only be used by these third parties for the fulfilment of their tasks. Any other use of the above information is inadmissible.</p>
      <p>You will receive the transfer confirmation and contact data and further information from the driver or the taxi and limousine company (first and last name, telephone number, license plate, vehicle type) and updates regarding the journey via your e-mail address. </p>
      <p>To be able to use our services in a country outside the European Union (hereinafter referred to as �third country�) the transfer of your personal data to the respective fleet company or the external fleet partner as well as to the respective driver executing the ride in such a third country is necessary for the performance of our contractual obligations.</p>
      <p><strong>FEEDBACK REQUESTS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER</strong></p>
      <p>After every trip, you will be requested by e-mail to rate the driver and the vehicle. This rating only serves for quality assurance and improvement of customer satisfaction. The rides quality is reflected by a star system. The quality standards are important to us and we want to know if you are unhappy with the transportation service. Under this circumstance, we will get back to you by e-mail to ask questions about your transfer. At the bottom of each rating e-mail, you will find a link to unsubscribe at any time. </p>
      <p><strong>RIGHT OF AFFECTED PERSONS</strong></p>
      <p>You have a right, subject to certain exemptions, to receive a copy of any data, which personally identifies you, held by us. You should email us with your Data Access Request by using the online contact form. You should include adequate information to identify yourself and, such other relevant information that you may have that will reasonably assist us in fulfilling your request.</p>
      <p>You also have a right to have inaccuracies in the personal data we hold about you corrected. If you discover that we hold inaccurate personal information about you, you may instruct us to correct that information.</p>
      <p><strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA WHEN USING OUR WEBSITE</strong></p>
      <p><strong>ACCESS DATA/ SERVER-LOG FILES</strong></p>
      <p>In case our website is exclusively used for information purposes, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise provide us with information, we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server (server log files/access data).
